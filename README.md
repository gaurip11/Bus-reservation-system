OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:-

    The objective and scope of my Project Bus Reservation System is to record the details various activities of user. 
    It will simplifies the task and reduse the paper work.
    This system will greatly simplfy and speed up the reservation of seats in bus.
    The system is very user friendly and it is anticipated that functions of the system will be easily accessed by administrators, academics, students and applicants. 


FEATURES:-

     1) Works for both administrator and user.
     
     2) Sign up, login, Forgotten password functions.
     
     3) Add bus details.
     
     4) Booking and Reservation of seats.
     
     5) Searching , Updating and Cancellation of seats .
     
     6)View bus details , Route details , Seat reservation details .
     
     7)Renew function helps to renewing the bus and seat details at the end of the day.


DATA STRUCTURES USED and WHY? :-

 1.ARRAYS:

       -In an array, accessing an element is very easy by using the index number. 
       
       -The search process can be applied to an array easily. 
       
       -For any reason a user wishes to store multiple values of similar type then the Array can be used and 
        utilized efficiently. 
        
       -Arrays have constant search times or Big O of one (O(1)), which is very fast. Fundamentally, the best 
        possible run time complexity is O(1).

2.File:

     -Backup: It is possible to take faster and automatic back-up of database stored in files of computer-based 
       systems. Computer systems provide functionalities to serve this purpose.it is also possible to develop 
       specific application program for this purpose.
       
     -Compactness: It is possible to store data compactly. 
     
     -Data Retrieval: Computer-based systems provide enhanced data retrieval techniques to retrieve data stored 
       in files in easy and efficient way.
       
     -Editing: It is easy to edit any information stored in computers in form of files. Specific application 
       programs or editing software can be used for this purpose. 
       
     -Sharing: Data stored in files of computer-based systems ca be shared among multiple users at a same time.
     
     
WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM THIS PROJECT:-

    -File handling.
    
    -Some new functions such as sleep(), system("cls"), etc.
    
    -Time and space complexity.
    
    -Organising various functions in proper manner.
    
    -Choosing efficient data structures.
    
    
WHAT NEXT FOR THE PROJECT

    -Modify this project by using trees and graphs as trees will help user to find the nearest seat possible, 
     to find window seat etc.
     
    -We will modify it by adding gender information so that it will be easy for user to choose a seat according 
     to their comfort.
     
    -Build a front end for proper visualization and to make it user friendly.
